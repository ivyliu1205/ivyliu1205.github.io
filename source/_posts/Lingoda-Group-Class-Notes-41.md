## What I've learned

### Idioms
**No news is good news**
- **Meaning**: If you don’t hear any news, then you can assume that nothing is wrong
- **Example**: *We haven’t heard anything yet from the hospital, but I guess **no news is good news**.*

### Expressions

As the old saying goes: “Rules are meant to be broken!” When it comes to grammar, many journalists would agree. Many rules of the English language that you might have learned don’t always apply in news headlines. Take a look at these examples:

- Explosion in fireworks factory; 20 workers injured
- Princess to marry popstar
- Farmer loses court case

In each one of these headlines, the **verb** is different to how it should be in speech.

| Headline                                           | Description                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Explosion in fireworks factory; 20 workers injured | Verb to be is missing                                |
| Princess to marry popstar                          | Verb is in the infinitive                            |
| Farmer loses court case                            | Verb is in present simple tense, and not the perfect |
 
Journalists often break rules to save space or make a headline catchier. Compare the headlines with normal spoken or written English to see the difference.

 
| Headline                                           | Normal English                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Explosion in fireworks factory; 20 workers injured | There **has been** an explosion in a fireworks factory; 20 workers **have been** injured. |
| Princess to marry popstar                          | A princess **is going** to marry a popstar.                                               |
| Farmer loses court case                            | A farmer **has lost** a court case.                                                       |
 
You will also note that headlines leave out **indefinite** and **definite articles**, such as **a**, **an**, and **the**.

Joanne feels like a new teacher on Lingoda. She isn’t very familiar with the course material, as she often reads it line by line. However, she is a dedicated teacher and asked us to give her feedback so she can improve. I hope she does great in the future.
