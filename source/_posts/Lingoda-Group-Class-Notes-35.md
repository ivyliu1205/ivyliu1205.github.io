## What I've learned

### Idioms
**a people person**
- Meaning: someone who is outgoing and loves working with people
- Example: *Leah is a real **people person** – she’d be a great tour guide.*

### Vocabularies & Phrases

#### Joining two sentences

> Where one sentence represents something extra, **also** is the most natural link. You can also use **furthermore** or **moreover** in a formal written application. These words are generally followed by a *comma*.

 
| A                                        | Link                               | B                                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| I am an experienced call-centre manager. | **Also / furthermore / moreover**, | I hold a professional management qualification. |
| I took on several projects in this area. | **Also / furthermore / moreover**, | I participated in various training courses.     |

#### Expressing time and sequence

> You can use words like **before**, **after**, **during**, or **following** at the beginning of a sentence to indicate the order in which you have done things.

- **Before** my degree in Management, I worked in the hospitality industry.
- **After** my degree in Management, I worked in the hospitality industry.
- **During** my degree in Management, I worked in the hospitality industry.
- **Following** my degree in Management, I worked in the hospitality industry.

#### Adding something

> In a job application, **In addition to** is an elegant way of introducing something else you have done. Note that it is used either with a **noun** or with the **-ing** form of a verb.
 
- **In addition to** my qualifications in project management,	I hold a degree in modern languages.
- **In addition to** working in the hospitality sector,	I have been studying for a degree.

### Expressions
> Structuring a cover letter

- **Address your letter to the hiring manager**. Try to find out their name if possible.
- **Tell them why you are** writing, the title of the position, and where you saw the advert.
- **List your skills and experience**: how do you meet the requirements for the position?
- **Tell them how they can contact you**. Let them know you are waiting for their reply.
- **Sign off** with a formal closing.

Trevon was excellent at offering encouragement and explaining new words and phrases clearly. He also prepared additional learning materials for us. He’s similar to most of the Lingoda teachers.
