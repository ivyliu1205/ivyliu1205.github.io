### Expressions
> Describing places with adjectives

An **adjective** is a word which describes a **noun** or a **pronoun**.

{% note info %}
- San Francisco is such a **great** place to live. 
- Which areas of London are **trendy** at the moment?
{% endnote %}

As you know, there is some variation in how we form adjectives in English. Some adjectives are simple and you'll already be familiar with them: **green, busy, quiet, loud, cheap, expensive, popular**. We also form adjectives from **nouns** and **verbs** or combinations of the two.

#### Forming adjectives from verbs
Note the use of the different endings:

{% note info %}
- attract - attractive
- live - lively
- love - lovely
{% endnote %}

We can also use the **gerund (-ing)** or **past participle** of some verbs as an adjective:

{% note info %}
- to bustle - bustling
- to relax - relaxed
{% endnote %}

#### Forming adjectives from nouns
Note the use of the different endings:

{% note info %}
- class – classy
- fashion - fashionable
- industry - industrial
- price - pricey
{% endnote %}

In some cases, new adjectives can even be made from nouns described by other adjectives. These are called **compound adjectives**.

{% note info %}
- high end - high-end
- working class - working-class
{% endnote %}

{% note warn %}
Note: Remember the **hyphen** when you are writing compound adjectives.
