This class is a B1.2 level, which is below my level of B1.3, so the content is quite simple for me. My classmate and I easily answer each question correctly. However, I noticed that our teacher, Kirsty, seemed a bit bored. She didn't give us much feedback after we answered questions or discussed any interesting topics. Despite this, Kirsty is a friendly teacher.
