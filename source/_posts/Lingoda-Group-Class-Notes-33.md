Ruben was a gentle and patient teacher who always listened carefully to our answers and corrected our speaking mistakes. He provided many interesting examples for each written exercise, though not guiding us through them was a minor flaw. Overall, I believe he is a good teacher, just like most of the teachers at Lingoda.
