### Grammar

#### Reporting speech
We use reported speech to say what somebody else **said** or **thought**.
{% note info %}
**Direct speech**: "This all-natural remedy will leave you feeling revitalised in minutes."
**Reported speech**: The advert said that this all-natural remedy would leave me feeling revitalised in minutes.
{% endnote %}
 
So how do we transform **direct speech** into **reported speech**?

{% note light %}
- We introduce reported speech using a **reporting verb** like **to say**, **to promise**, **to claim**. It is usually in the **past simple**: *The advert **said**...*
- We add **that** after the reporting verb: *The advert said **that** this...* 
- We put the verbs in the sentence **back** one tense: e.g. ***will** leave -> **would** leave*.
- We change any **pronouns** (*I, you, he* etc) and **possessives** (*my, your, her* etc.) to reflect who is speaking: *will leave **you** feeling...* -> *would leave **me** feeling....*
{% endnote %}

We can also leave **that** out from the sentence. It is optional!

#### Reporting requests

When we report a request, we say what someone else **asked** or **told** us to do.

{% note info %}
**Direct request:** "Order your free sample now!"
**Reported request:** The advert said to order my free sample now.
{% endnote %}

{% note light %}
- To report a request, we introduce it with a reporting verb (**said**).
- We also change any pronouns(代名词) and possessives(所有格) (**your** to **my**) to reflect who is speaking.
- However, the verb in the request does **not** go in the past. It becomes an **infinitive**(不定式): *order (imperative) becomes to order (infinitive)*.
- All verbs in requests become infinitives. We also remove any modal verbs in the original request.
{% endnote %}

| Direct request                           | Reported request                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| "Give me your reference number, please." | He said to give him my reference number.     |
| "Can you give me your reference number?" | He asked me to give him my reference number. |
 
##### Using said, asked, and told
Most requests can be reported with **said**. **Asked** is used for polite requests and **told** for orders.

{% note info %}
The call operator **asked** me to give him my reference number.
The policeman **told** me to give him my identification.
{% endnote %}
 
{% note light %}
Note that said is never used with an **object** or **object pronouns** (me, you, him/her/it, us, them), while asked and told are always used with one.

✘ He **said** me to come in.
✓ He **said** to come in.

✘ He **told** to come in.
✓ He **told** me to come in.

Today was a grammar class, and I had to say that the teacher Sheryl, is the best grammar teacher at Lingoda. She taught in a clear and detailed way. When we didn't know the meaning of a word, she could always explain it in an easy-to-understand manner. 

Her teaching style reminded me of my English teacher in school, because unlike other Lingoda teachers who always let students answer the questions one by one. Sheryl's class didn't have a set order. However, she didn't miss anyone. If some students didn't answer the questions, she would call on them by name.
