### Grammar

#### Reported speech
Reported speech (or indirect speech) is the way we convey what someone else has said, in our own words. To form reported speech in English, it's important to remember the following: 

{% note info %}
- When building **reported speech**, we change **pronouns** from first person to third person.
- We also change the **verb tense**, e.g. present simple to past simple.

- Direct speech: *‘We went to an art exhibition,’ they said.*
- Reported speech: ***They said they had been** to an art exhibition.*

#### More reporting verbs
> promise; suggest; advise; claim; refuse; remind

| Direct speech                               | Reported speech                     |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| ‘No, I don’t want to go with you’, he said. | He **refused** to go with us.           |
| ‘Shall we go to Café Bella?’ they asked.    | They **suggested** we go to Café Bella. |

#### Reporting yes/no questions
> To report yes/no questions, use a **reporting verb + whether/if + clause**. You may use **whether** or **if** to report on questions that have yes/no answers. *Whether is more formal than if.*
- Direct speech: *‘Can I upgrade to business class?’ she asked.*
- Reported speech: *Someone asked if they could upgrade to business class.*

#### Reporting questions with question words
> This type of question is reported by using a **reporting verb + question word + clause**.

| Direct speech                   | Reported speech                |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| ‘What is your name?’ she asked. | She **asked** me **what** my name was. |
| ‘Where do you live?’ he asked.  | He **asked** me **where** I lived.     |

Desiree is a friendly teacher. She is really good at teaching grammar and controlling the pace of our class. Every time we finished our speaking, she always provided us with genuine encouragment. However, Desiree didn't provided detailed feedback, which is different from the kind of teacher I prefer.
