### Feedback for the class

Three Rules for the Pronunciation of **'ed'** when added to the end of present tense verbs to form past tense verbs:  

- ‘ed’ Rule 1: 
  - We ONLY pronounce BOTH letters of 'ed' as ED if the present tense verb ends in a 't' or a 'd', for example: wanted or skidded. 
  - In all other cases we do not pronounce the 'e' of 'ed', we only pronounce the 'd'. 
- ‘ed’ Rule 2. 
  - If a present tense verb ends in any voiced consonant (except d) such as (b, g, j, l, m, n, r, v, w, or z) or in a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u) which are also voiced, we pronounce the 'ed' as D. Examples with present tense verbs that end in voiced consonants: rained, fibbed, killed. Examples with present tense verbs that end in vowels: *lied*, *played*, or *skied*. 
- ‘ed’ Rule 3. 
  - If a present-tense verb ends in any UNvoiced consonant (except t); sounds that are only made with air and are not voiced: such as (f, k, p, s, ch, sh, or x) we do not voice the 'd' either, so we pronounce the 'ed' as T, for example: *asked*, *shipped*, *kissed*, or *fixed*. 
 
Three rules for the pronunciation of 's' when added to the end of words: (These 3 rules apply to all three of the situations where we add an 's' to the end of a word: 

  - We add an 's' when making a singular noun into a plural noun; cat to cats, zebra to zebras. 
  - We add apostrophe 's' when making a noun possessive; Bob to Bob's, Ray to Ray's, Pat to Pat's. 
  - We add an 's' when a verb is in a present tense sentence with a subject that is third person singular; I eat, he eats. We hum, she hums.) 
  
- 'S' Rule 1 
  - When a word ends in a sound that is not voiced, such as (f, k, p, t, or x), we do not voice the 's' either, so it sounds like a normal 's'. For example: *bats*, *ships*, *Jack's*, *Jeff's*, *shoots*, *slips*. 
- 'S' Rule 2 
  - When a word ends in a sound that is voiced, such as any voiced consonant (b, d, g, l, m, n, r, v, w, or y,) or any vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), we voice the 's' also, so it sounds like a 'z'. 
    - Examples with words that end in voiced consonants: *cribs, dogs, Phil's, Brad's, squeals, runs*. 
    - Examples with words that end in vowels: *skis, shoes, Peta's, Anna's, lies, sees*. 
- 'S' Rule 3 
  - The 5 Exceptions; 
    - When a word ends in the sound of ch, j, s, sh, or z, we add 2 sounds that sound like EZ, and we spell them as 'es' for plural nouns and third-person present tense verbs. 
      - Examples that end in 'ch': stiches, Mitch's, teaches. 
      - Examples that end in 'j' sounds: judges, Madge's, abridges. (voice the normally silent 'e') 
      - Examples that end in 's': kisses, boss's, tosses. 
      - Examples that end in 'sh': dishes, Nash's, washes. 
      - Examples that end in 'z': fuzzes, Boz's, fizzes.

**NOTE**: 
- Most people believe that when a name or a word that ends in 's' is made possessive we should only add an apostrophe, and not add apostrophe 's'. 
  - For example: the boss' office, or Chris' car. 
- The crazy part is that we still pronounce it as though we HAD added apostrophe 's'! 
  - For example, boss' is still pronounced as "bossez", Chris' is still pronounced as "Chrisez".
