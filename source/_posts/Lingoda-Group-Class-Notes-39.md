## What I've learned

### Idioms
**pigs might fly**
- Meaning: used to show you don’t believe something will ever happen
- Example: *- In 5 years’ time, all our jobs will have been replaced by robots. - Yes, and **pigs might fly**!*

### Grammar

#### The future continuous
{% note info %}
We form the future continuous with: **will be + v.-ing**.
We use it to talk about an action which will be in progress at a certain time in the future.
{% endnote %}

- This time tomorrow, I **will be exercising** at the gym.
- This time next week, we **will be sittin**g on a beach in the Bahamas. 

##### More uses of the future continuous
We also use it for actions which will happen in the **normal course of events**.
- I **will be seeing** John at dinner, so I‘ll give him your message.

Additionally, we can use it to ask politely or tentatively(adv.	初步；尝试性地；暂时性地) about the future.
- **Will** you **be seeing** James later?

{% note warn %}
When speaking, we often use the contracted forms **I'll be** seeing, **you'll be** seeing, **we'll be** seeing etc. 
{% endnote %}
#### The future perfect
{% note info %}
We form the future perfect using: **will have + past participle of the main verb**.
We use it to talk about an action which will be finished before a certain time in the future.
{% endnote %}
- I **will have finished** my tasks by 4 p.m.
- By this time next year, Sarah **will have graduated** from university.

##### The future perfect with by and in
We often use this tense with **by** and **in** to specify a particular point in the future. 

- He **will have finished** the report by tomorrow.
- I **will have retired** in 20 years’ time.

{% note warn %}
Other common future perfect expressions are **by this time**, **by the time** and **by the end of**.
