### Expressions
> Using collocations with 'trip' and 'journey'

The words **trip** and **journey** are similar but distinct.

- A **trip** is generally a short break away somewhere - and always ends back where it started. Children go on day-long or week-long school trips, for instance.
  - Field trip
  - School trip
  - Sightseeing trip
  - Business trip
- A **journey** may go on for much longer - and may never end. It can be figurative, too: "Life is a journey", as the old saying goes.
  - Personal journey
  - Cross-country journey

Also, **journey** is the word used for talking about the actual movement from a to b: 'How was your journey?' is what you ask when you want to know whether the train was on time, whether the flight was good, etc. 'How was your trip?' means you are asking about a holiday or a weekend away.

Owin is the kind of teacher I really like. He gives immediate feedback on our pronunciation after we answer the questions. In addition, he is really well-prepared for this class. He prepares a lot of images related to the new words in the class material to help us learn new words. I also like his teaching style because he lets us explain the meanings of words, helping us remember them and practice speaking at the same time.
