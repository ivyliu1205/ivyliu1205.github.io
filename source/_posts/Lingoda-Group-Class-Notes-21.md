## What I've learned

Christina was a different kind of teacher. She taught without strictly following the execises in the learning materials. She didn't ask us to complete all the execises once she knew we had mastered the material, which saved a lot of time. Additionally, she helped us get familar with new vocabulary by having us make up questions using the new word, and then having other classmates answer thee. This helped us become familar with the vocabulary and practice our speaking. I liked her teaching styles.
