### Grammar

#### Changing the verb tense
{% note info %}
If you are relaying speech that is **still true** at the time you are reporting it or **always true**, the verb tense can stay the same.

- She shared that **she’s working** on a new album.
- He admitted that **he loves** reality TV.
- They reminded me that **their film comes out** next month.

Maria is a different kind of teacher, she teaches through open dialogue. She shared a lot about her life and then encouraged us to discuss her experiences using the day's lesson content. She also recommended many additional learning resources. Unfortunately, my internet connection was poor today and kept crashing during the class, causing me to miss a lot. Thankfully, today's lesson was a summary of the previous class.
