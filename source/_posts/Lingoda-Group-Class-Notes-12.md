## Review

{% endnote %}

This class was supposed to be a two-student communication class, but another classmate didn't show up, so it became a one-on-one class. And that's the reason why I learned so much today. David is a highly experienced professional English teacher. He has taught in many countries as an English teacher, including 2 years in Chengdu. He gave me a lot of encouragement and helpful feedback patiently. This class experience was excellent.
