### Grammar

#### Passive & active voice

Here is an example of a sentence that uses the **passive voice**:

{% note info %}
The room is being painted by my dad.
{% endnote %}

The same sentence using the **active voice** would be:
{% note info %}
My dad is painting the room.
{% endnote %}
 

We form the passive voice with a form of **to be + the past participle** of the main verb:
{% note info %}
The room is being painted.
{% endnote %}

In a passive sentence, we **don’t need** to say who does the action. If we want to, we use the preposition **by**.
{% note info %}
The room is being painted by my dad.
{% endnote %}

#### Tenses

|           Tense            |            Example             |
| :------------------------: | :----------------------------: |
|    Past simple passive     |    The house **was built**.    |
|    Past perfect passive    | The house **had been built**.  |
|  Past continuous passive   | The house **was being built**. |
| Present continuous passive | The house **is being built**.  |
|   Future simple passive    |  The house **will be built**.  |
|   Present simple passive   |    The house **is built**.     |
|  Present perfect passive   | The house **has been built**.  |

#### Passive with get

{% note info %}
- In *informal* speech, we can use **get + past participle** instead of **be + past participle**.
- The passive with **get** can suggest either an unexpected or a negative experience.
{% endnote %}

- I **got accepted** into Yale University – I can’t believe it!
- My watch **got stolen** while I was in Barcelona!

## Review

{% endnote %}

In the first 15 minutes of the class, my network was accidentally lost, so I missed the self-introduction time and the first two pages of slides. However, the most important content of today's class wasn't affected. Grant also taught by strictly following the learning materials, but he always gives us some ideas when we answer the questions. Today's class was okay, but not excellent for me.
