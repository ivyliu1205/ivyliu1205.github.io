### Grammar
> Reviewing use of the '-ing' form

**-ing** can be an ending for *nouns*, *adjectives*, and *verbs*. That makes it difficult to identify what the role of a word is in some sentences – and difficult to follow explanations of English grammar!

So let’s look at a few examples of the **-ing** form and make sure we understand how they work.

| Role                           | Example                                                                  |
| :----------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| VERB (PRESENT PARTICIPLE)      | I have been **trying** to understand English grammar for years.          |
| ADJECTIVE                      | English grammar can be really **interesting**.                           |
| VERB PATTERN                   | I enjoy **studying** English grammar.                                    |
| SET PHRASE (BY + -ING)         | By regularly **revising** English grammar, I became better at it.        |
| SET PHRASE (AS WELL AS + -ING) | As well as **mastering** English grammar, I also mastered pronunciation. |
 
#### Verb
As you know, the present participle (-ing) is used to form continuous tenses in English:
- I am still **studying** this example sentence. **(present continuous)**
- I have been **trying** to understand it all day. **(present perfect continuous)**

#### Adjective
Lots of -ing forms can be used as **adjectives** to describe a characteristic:

- English grammar can be quite **frustrating**. 
 
#### Verb pattern
Some verbs such as to enjoy or to consider combine with other verbs in the -ing form:

- I have **considered trying** to get by without grammar, but it’s no good.
 
#### Set phrases
Some set phrases in English use the -ing form. Two important ones are:

- **by + -ing**: This means that doing one thing helped you to do another.
  - **By returning** to the topic again and again, I eventually learned all the uses of  the -ing form in English.

- **as well as + -ing**: This means that in addition to doing one thing, you did another. Both are equally important.
  - **As well as learning** how to use -ing, I learned lots of new vocabulary.
