## What I've learned

### Idioms
**to think highly of someone or something**

- **Meaning**: to have a very positive opinion of someone or something.
- **Example**: *I **think very highly of** Margaret’s advice. She always has great suggestions!*

### Grammar

#### Verbs that take both 'to' + infinitive and the '-ing' form

As you know, when two verbs appear together, they follow a pattern.

In some cases, the first verb is followed by **to + infinitive**. In others, by a verb in the **-ing form**.

Take **hope** and **enjoy**: you **hope to do** something but you **enjoy doing** it.

Some verbs can **only** be followed by **to + infinitive** or the **-ing form**. It is wrong to use the other construction.

{% note info %}
✘ He **enjoys to meet** new people.
✓ He **enjoys meeting** new people.

✘ They're **thinking of to split up**.
✓ They’re t**hinking of splitting up**.

✘ They **managed meeting up** last week.
✓ They **managed to meet up** last week.
{% endnote %}

##### Verbs which can take either to + infinitive or -ing form
Some verbs can be followed by either without a change in meaning:
{% note info %}
- He **likes to talk/talking** about himself.
- He **loves to talk/talking** about himself.
{% endnote %}

{% note info %}
Be careful with **would + like**, **love** and **prefer**. They use **to + infinitive**:
✘ She **would like meeting** new people.
✓ She **would like to meet** new people.
{% endnote %}

##### Verbs that change their meaning between to + infinitive or -ing form
Some verbs can be followed by either, but the meaning of the sentence **changes**.
 
**Remember** has two meanings depending on whether it is used with **to + infinitive** or **-ing form**.
{% note info %}
- He remembered **to meet** you. (=He didn’t forget to pick you up.)
- He remembers **meeting** you. (=He hasn’t forgotten that he met you once.)
{% endnote %}

**Try** also has two different meanings depending on whether it is followed by **to + infinitive** or **-ing form**.
{% note info %}
- Try **to do** some exercise every day. (=I know you'll find this difficult, but it's important.)
- Try **doing** some exercise every day. (=I'm suggesting this as an experiment. It shouldn't be too difficult.)
{% endnote %}

**Stop** changes its meaning completely with the two patterns.
{% note info %}
- She hasn't stopped **to think** about it. (=She has given the matter no thought at all.)
- She hasn't stopped **thinking** about it. (=She has been thinking about it all the time.)
{% endnote %}
