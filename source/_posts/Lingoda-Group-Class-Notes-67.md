### Expressions

Here are some tips for putting empathy into practice while speaking to someone:

{% note info %}
* Let the person **talk freely**, meaning you listen actively and don't interrupt them.
* Keep your **body language** in mind: hold eye contact and move your eyebrows up while they're speaking.
* Put your viewpoints aside and **focus on understanding** how the person must have felt in that situation.
* Try to express yourself **sincerely** and avoid giving false hope or ‘magic solutions’ to their problems!
