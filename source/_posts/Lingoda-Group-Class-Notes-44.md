### Grammar

#### Using the present for the future

In some specific cases, a common way to talk about the future in English is to use the **present simple**. This is when a fixed arrangement is due to take place in the near future (same day, coming days or weeks).

- We **leave** tomorrow at 6am.
- Next Wednesday, **I'm** at a concert.
- He **goes** to Paris next week.

In all of these cases, the future with **going to** would be equally natural; the future with **will** would sound formal.

Another possibility is to use the **present continuous**.

- We **'re leaving** tomorrow at 6am.
- He **'s going** to Paris next week.

{% note warn %}
**Remember**: The present continuous cannot be used with **to be** as the main verb.

✘ Next Wednesday, I'm being at a concert
✓ Next Wednesday, I'm at a concert.
✓ Next Wednesday, I'm going to be at a concert.
✓ Next Wednesday, I'll be at a concert.
{% endnote %}

#### Using the future continuous

The **future continuous** is formed using **will + be + present participle** of the main verb. It adds another shade of meaning to the **simple future** and **present tenses** used for the future.

{% note info %}
- I'm going on holiday tomorrow. By this time next week, I'**ll be sipping** cocktails on a sun-lounger(阳光躺椅).
- She says that the cruise will be a great opportunity to meet people and that she'**ll be chatting** to everyone she comes across.
- Look at those clouds. It'**ll be raining cats and dogs** by the time we get back to the hotel.
{% endnote %}

Unlike other forms of the future, the future continuous cannot be used to describe plans or intentions. It always means that something will happen naturally or as a result of something else. Look at these contrasting examples.

{% note info %}
- I'**m going to go** on holiday next month. (going to-future: I want to go on holiday and will make arrangements.)

- I think I'**ll go** on holiday next month. (will-future/future simple: I want to go on holiday and there's no reason I can't.)

- I'**ll be going** on holiday next month. (future continuous: I've already made the arrangements so it's going to happen.)
{% endnote %}
 
##### Time and cause
The two most common uses for the future continuous are to talk about things that **will be happening** at a certain time and things that **will be happening** in the natural course of events.

{% note info %}
Adverbial constructions like **By this time next tomorrow/next week/next year** or **At 8:00 on 14th March** often lead to the future continuous.

Things that will happen in the future without interference are best described using the **future continuous**.
{% endnote %}

#### Understanding the future with 'going to' and 'will'

There are two ways of forming the future of verbs in English.

##### Going to
The future can be expressed with **going to + infinitive** (without **to**).

{% note info %}
- It’**s going to be** a great holiday!
- We'**re going to go** to Tenerife again next year.
- I’**m going to take** some time off as soon as I can.
{% endnote %}

##### Will
The future can also be expressed with **will + infinitive** (without **to**).

{% note info %}
- Our holiday **will begin** the moment we leave the house.
- In 50 years’ time, these holiday photos **will** still **make** me smile.
- Our next trip abroad **will** probably be at Christmas.
{% endnote %}

##### Using going to and will

In many cases, there is no difference between the future with **going to** and with **will**.

If there is strong evidence for something, or something has already started happening, we use **going to**:

{% note info %}
- The flight hasn't even come up on the board yet. They’**re going to be** delayed.
- From what I hear, tickets for the festival **are going to go** on sale on Tuesday.
{% endnote %}

If we are making a guess about what will happen or expressing a belief, we use **will**:

{% note info %}
- I don’t think he'**ll like** Turkey. It's too hot there for his tastes!
- They sounded quite certain that the cruise **will happen**.
{% endnote %}

Bernie is excellent at explaining grammar. He uses both visuals and examples to clarify subtle differences in grammar. He also consistently points out our mistakes during speaking. Additionally, he goes beyond Lingoda's teaching materials to teach in a more engaging and accessible way. I enjoy his teaching style and hope to see him in a speaking or communication class.
