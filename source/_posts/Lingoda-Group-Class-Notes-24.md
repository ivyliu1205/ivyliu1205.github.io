## What I've learned

### Idioms
**to twist someone’s arm**
- Meaning: to persuade someone to do something they don’t want to do.
- Example: *I’ve **twisted his arm** and he’s going to give you a discount on the tickets.*

### Grammar
>  We use a **causative structure** to talk about something that someone else did for us or another person.

- I **got** my hair **cut** last week
- Tina **had** her TV **fixed** yesterday.

{% note light %}
Causative because the subject caused the action to happen but didn’t do it themselves.
{% endnote %} 

#### Have / get + object + past participle
{% note info %}
We use this structure when we **arrange** or **pay** someone to do something for us.
{% endnote %} 

- I **had** my car **washed**.
- We **got** our nails **painted**.
 
{% note light %}
**Get** is more informal than **have**.
{% endnote %} 

#### Have + person + bare infinitive + object
{% note info %}
We use this structure when we **ask**, **arrange** or **pay** someone to do something and we say who did it.
{% endnote %} 

- I **had** my brother **wash** my car.
- We **had** my Mum **paint** our nails.

{% note light %}
The **bare infinitive** is another way of saying the infinitive without 'to': *wash*, *paint*, *order*.
{% endnote %} 

#### Get + person + full infinitive + object
{% note info %}
We use this structure when we **persuade** someone to do something and say who did it.
{% endnote %} 

- I **got** my brother **to** wash my car.
- We **got** my Mum **to** paint our nails.

{% note light %}
Remember to use the **full infinitive** in this structure: *to wash, to paint, to order*.
{% endnote %}

Will is an experienced English teacher with over 20 years of experience teaching in Thailand. He reminds me a lot of my high school English teacher, David. He explains grammar in a clear and understandable way and gives valuable feedback. After class, he sends each of us a summary of the lesson. He's truly an excellent teacher.
