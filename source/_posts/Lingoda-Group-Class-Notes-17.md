### Expressions
{% note info %}
**Open-ended questions** are questions we cannot answer with **yes** or **no**.
{% endnote %}

They help **deepen** a conversation and make it flow better:

- How do you know the host of the party?
- Well, I first met Jane at an evening class...
 
{% note info %}
**Yes/no questions** are **not** open-ended questions.
{% endnote %}
Using **too many** of them can make continuing a conversation **more difficult**:
- Do you know the host of the party?
- **Yes**, I do.

{% note info %}
Open-ended questions often start with **how**, **what** or **why**
{% endnote %}
- **What** brings you to London?
- **How** would you describe your job?
 
{% note info %}
We can add **So** or **So tell me** (to the beginning) or **then** (to the end) to sound more casual
{% endnote %}

Will is a patient teacher who always listens to us actively. However, he teaches by following the lecture slides strictly, and has us answer every question on them. This made me feel like he wasn't familiar with the lecture materials. There were four students in today's class, but he didn't have us answer the questions one by one like my other teachers do, which made the class a bit messy. Additionally, he didn't provide any feedback, he just wrote down our answers in the notes without offering any comments.
