I really like the learning materials provided by Lingoda. They are well-structured, and the topics they choose are also interesting and useful. I was not familar with today's topic before class, but the content in the material helped me a lot during the class. I learnt a lot from today's class.

The teacher, Danielle, is very patient and gentle. She always point out the mistakes we made in our speaking. In this class, she led us to through all the speaking and vocabulary sections in the learning material. Becuase we only have three students in the class, I had many opportunities to speak. That was great.
