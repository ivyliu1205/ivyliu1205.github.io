### Expressions

> Using discourse markers in a formal presentation

When giving a formal presentation, you can use a variety of phrases in each section.

| Introduction                                      | Contents                             | Conclusion                      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Thank you for coming.                             | So, let’s get started with...        | To sum up...                    |
| Could I have your attention, please?              | Moving on to...                      | To conclude...                  |
| I would like to start by...                       | Let’s move on to...                  | In summary...                   |
| Today, I’m going to cover...                      | Now, I’d like to talk you through... | Thank you for listening.        |
| I’m delighted to be able to present to you today. | And, last but not least...           | Does anyone have any questions? |
 
#### To be delighted to vs. to be happy to
{% note warn %}
- **To be delighted to** is a polite way of saying you are **happy** to do something.
- **To be happy to** is actually not very polite. It means you would **prefer not** to do something.
{% endnote %}

Compare these two examples:

{% note info %}
- I'm **happy to** take you through it again if you think it's necessary *(= but I'd prefer not to!)*.
- I'm **delighted to** be presenting to you here today *(=I'm very happy to be here)*
{% endnote %}
 
#### Infinitive at the beginning of a phrase
Using an **infinitive** at the beginning of a phrase is common in presentations.

It shows you intend to do something.

{% note info %}
- **To get** us started, I thought I'd talk you through our figures.
- **To conclude**, I think you'll agree that we have a convincing proposal.
{% endnote %}

Jesse is a supportive teacher, who always gave encourages and acknowledgements to us. However, he was not good at controlling the step of the class, so it's always become a mess when he asked a questions. Also, instead of leading us to go through the materials, he let us watch the materials and ask questions by ourself, I thought it was not a good way to teach. After all, Jesse is a good teacher.
