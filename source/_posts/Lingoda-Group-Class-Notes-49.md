### Grammar

As you know, the **comparative** form of adjectives is what we use when we are comparing the characteristic of one noun to that of another.

{% note info %}
- This ball is **bigger** than that ball.
- Basketball is **more popular** than netball.
- It's a **less physical** sport than rugby (n.	橄榄球运动).
{% endnote %}

Often, you need to modify comparatives to add some detail or make a point clear.

#### Quantifying comparatives with *a little*, *a lot*, *much* etc.
One thing might be better than another, but by how much? Here are some of the modifiers you can use.

| less                 | more              |
| -------------------- | ----------------- |
| slightly better/more | a lot better/more |
| a litte better/more  | much better/more  |
| a bit better/more    | far better/more   |

Here are some examples:

{% note info %}
- Overall, the team was ***much* fitter** and in ***much* better** condition than last month.
- I thought the goalkeeper was ***slightly* more aware** in the second half.
- These shoes are ***far* better** for playing tennis than those ones.
{% endnote %}

#### Slightly, a little, and a bit
**Slighty**, **a little**, and **a bit** often occur with **only**. This usually express disappointment.

{% note info %}
Despite all that training, we were **only slightly quicker** to the ball than we were last week.
{% endnote %}

#### Lots, a lot, and much
**Lots**, **a lot**, and **much** can be combined with the **negative form** of the **verb**. This is like ***only slightly*** or **only a bit**.

{% note info %}
Despite all that training, we were**n't much quicker** to the ball than we were last week.
{% endnote %}
 
{% note warn %}
**Note**: this doesn't work with far:
- **✘** He wasn't far more engaged in the game this week
- **✓** He was**n't much more** engaged in the game this week.
{% endnote %}

#### Explaining similarities and differences
When we compare things, we often want to underline similarities or differences.

If two things are the same, we say that they are **the same as** each other. If they share a characteristic to the same degree, we say that they are **as + adjective + as** each other.

{% note info %}
- Rounders is more or less **the same as** baseball.
- These days, cricket is just **as commercial as** football.
{% endnote %}

If they share a likeness (but are not exactly the same), we say that they **are similar to** each other.

{% note info %}
- Rugby **is similar to** football in that you have to get a ball into a goal.
- Water polo **is similar to** basketball and football, but it's played swimming.
{% endnote %}

If the two things are not alike, we say they are **different from** each other.

{% note info %}
- Cricket is quite **different from** baseball.
- The two players are actually quite **different from** each other.
{% endnote %}

We can highlight differences using **not as + adjective + as**.

{% note info %}
The rules of baseball are **not as complicated as** those of cricket.
{% endnote %}
