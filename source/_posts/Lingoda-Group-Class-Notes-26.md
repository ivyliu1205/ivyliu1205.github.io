## What I've learned

### Idioms
**to be a bag of nerves**
- Meaning: to be very nervous
- Example: *I hate public speaking. I’m always **a bag of nerves** before I get on stage!*

### Expressions

#### Describing a product
> Advertising uses persuasive or exaggerated(夸张) language to make you want to buy something.
- to ditch 丢弃
- to bounce back
- instantly
- a thing of the past
- up to

#### Compound adjectives 复合形容词
> Compound adjectives have two or more words joined with a hyphen(连字符号) that together form one idea.
- cutting-edge
- all-natural
- interest-free
- million-dollar
- high-tech
- best-selling
- tried-and-tested
- etc.

#### Describing advertising techniques
- Pressure to buy via **urgency**
- Facts and figures in the form of **scientific research**
- Persuades you to jump on the bandwagon(时尚) and be part of the crowd
- Uses bribery(贿赂) by offering something for free

#### Using reported speech
> We use reported speech to say what someone else said or thought.
For example, to refer to another person’s beliefs or opinions or to review a company.

#### Forming reported speech
- We introduce reported speech using a reporting verb. This verb is usually in the **past simple**.
- After the reporting verb, we can add *that* but can also leave *that* out.
- When we transform direct speech into reported speech we usually put the verb in the past and we
change the pronoun to reflect who is now speaking.

#### Reporting requests and orders
- We use **asked** or **told** to report requests and orders.
-Both verbs need a *direct object + to infinitive*. The object is who we gave the request or order to
(e.g. I asked them to do something.; I told her to do something).
- *Ask* is for a request; *told* is for an order.

#### Talking about the structure of a presentation:
- **Introduction**: introduce yourself and give the main subject of the presentation
- **Main body**: the most informative part of the presentation
- **Conclusion**: summarise what you have said
- **Discussion**: invite the audience to ask questions

#### Useful phrases for a presentation:
- **Introduction**: 
  - Thank you for coming
  - Could I have your attention, please?
  - I would like to start by…
  - Today, I’m going to cover…
  - I’m delighted to be able to present to you today.
- **Main body**: 
  - So, let’s get started with…
  - Moving on to…
  - Let’s move on to…
  - Now, I’d like to talk you through…
  - And, last but not least…
- **Conclusion**: 
  - To sum up…
  - To conclude…
  - In summary…
  - Thank you for listening.
  - Does anyone have any questions

This is my second time with Claire, and she is my favorite teacher at Lingoda. Claire always listens to us carefully and provides everyone with detailed and constructive feedback. She creates a supportive and engaging learning environment that encourages participation and growth. After class, she also shares more useful learning resource to us. Her teaching style is both effective and enjoyable, making complex topics easier to understand. I like Claire's class so much.
