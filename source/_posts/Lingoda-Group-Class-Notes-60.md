## What I've learned

### Idioms
**That’s a wrap!**

- **Meaning**: The phrase comes from film-making – it means that a scene is completed. We use
it to say that something is finished or complete. 
- **Example**: *(After a meeting) Ok, **that’s a wrap!** Great job, guys.*

### Expressions
> Organising written information

If you want to give a detailed account of something or make an argument, it's good to know some standard phrases for organising information. This will help to structure your writing and therefore make it easier for a reader to follow your text.
 
#### Referring to a source of information
Explaining where you found information is very important in order to strengthen an argument or prove a point. A good phrase to quote from a source is **according to + noun**.

{% note info %}
**According to the Financial Times**, public funding for films has risen sharply over the last decade.
{% endnote %}

Note that **according to** can also be used to reference **a study or survey**, as in the following example:

{% note info %}
According to **an industry survey conducted by the Financial Times**, the number of film directors who receive subsidies has doubled.
{% endnote %}
 
#### Suggesting a reason or cause
To suggest that something is the reason or the cause of something else, a common way to do this is to talk about **factors responsible for/behind** something.
{% note info %}
- **One factor responsible for** the growing popularity of documentary is the increased availability of digital recording equipment.
- **Another factor behind** the rise of documentary-making is the sheer number of people receiving media studies training.
{% endnote %}
 
#### Adding another point
To make complex arguments, you often need to explain more than one element. To avoid simply saying *and*, English has a variety of linking words.

{% note info %}
- **Additionally**, there is a high demand for good quality documentary films.
- **In addition**, with the rise of video platforms, the potential audience for films has grown.
- **Moreover**, the number of high-profile awards ceremonies for documentary-makers has increased.
