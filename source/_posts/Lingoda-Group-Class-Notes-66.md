### Dialogue

**A:** Our friend Katherine is a comedian! I was so surprised to find out. How did I miss this?

**B:** You didn't know? I did, I caught her last comedy show and was blown away by the act.

**A:** Well, hat's off to her for getting up here, I would never be able to do that. It's so brave.

**B:** To be honet, the whole line-up was pretty good, but the venue wasn't the best.

**A:** Comedy is really hit or miss for me. Unless, I happen to really love a certain comedian, I rarely go.

**B:** She is performing again next month, and there are a variety of artists. There's something for everyone.

**A:** Would you mind if I joined you? I'd really like to go and support her.

**B:** Of course. You will be amazed by how funny she is. A real storyteller!
