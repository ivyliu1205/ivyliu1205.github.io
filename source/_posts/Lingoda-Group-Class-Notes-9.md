### Grammar

#### consist in vs. consist of

{% note info %}
- Some people say a key point to know which one to use is that **"consist of" is normally used with more tangible(有形的) objects** whereas **"consist in" refers to an abstract quality**.

- Others also say that **"consist of" is always followed by a noun phrase**, whereas **"consist in" is followed by a verb**.

| :--------: | :-----------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| consist of |      to be made up of, comprise       |                           *This novel **consists of** three parts.*                           |
| consist in | be essentially, be inherent or lie in | *His social success **consists in** making people believe he is interested in what they say.* |

#### think about vs. think of

{% note info %}
**"Think about"** is used when you're actively considering something or concentrating on the thought of it.
  
  Ex. *Let me think ABOUT it.*

On the other hand, **"think of"** is used when the idea comes to you.

  Ex. *I never thought OF that.*

In most other cases, they are very similar and can be used interchangeably. Especially for actions in the future.

  Ex. *I'm thinking ABOUT/OF going on a trip.*

## Review

This is my first communication class. From the learning material, I can see that the goal of these kinds of classes is to teach us how to communicate in real life, as it includes spoken words. The content is quite fun, and I plan to take more communication classes in the future. However, Adrian's teaching style does not rely heavily on the learning material. She prefers teaching through conversation, so she spends a lot of time talking with us and pointing out mistakes in our speech. This teaching style is quite enjoyable. Adrian is also a chatty person. I like her class, but it would be much better if she focused more on the learning material.
