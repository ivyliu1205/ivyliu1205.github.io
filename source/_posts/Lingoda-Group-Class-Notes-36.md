## What I've learned

### Idioms
**A dream come true**
- Meaning: You can use this idiom when something you have been wishing for or have
always wanted comes true
- Example: *I got transferred to a new job in the Spanish office of our company, so I’m moving to Seville. I love Spain, so it’s **a dream come true**!*

### Expressions

When it comes to describing places and talking about their importance, several set phrases in English use a **noun** followed by **of**.

{% note info %}
- This area of the city has a long **history of** immigration.
- Dublin has a strong **tradition of** storytelling.
{% endnote %}
 
This construction can also be used to indicate a relationship between a place and an important figure.

{% note info %}
- This was the last **residence of** the Emperor.
- The city is considered the **birthplace of** punk-rock.
{% endnote %}

**Note**: When talking about specific figures, the **possessive 's** is also common.

*This was the Emperor **'s** last residence.*

Sean is quite a young teacher and seems a bit nervous at times, but he effectively guides the class at a steady pace. He’s also a good listener, much like most of the other Lingoda teachers.
