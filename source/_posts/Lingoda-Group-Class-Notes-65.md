### Grammar
> Giving background information with the past continuous

As you know, the past continuous describes something that was happening over a period of time. That’s why it often used to set the scene for an anecdote.

Here’s how this sounds:

{% note info %}
- A few weeks ago, I **was cycling** to work one morning, when this car pulled out in front of me…
- One summer before university, when I **was working** in a restaurant, there was this customer…
- Something funny happened to me once – it was back when I **was living** in France…
{% endnote %}

In anecdotes, the past continuous has two functions.

To give the listener **general background information** – e.g. where you were living at the time, and what was going on

{% note info %}
- It was back in 2003. I **was finishing** my degree and **looking** for a job.
- So this happened last summer while I **was staying with** my sister for a few weeks.
- Everyone **was talking** about the presentation and **working** really hard.
{% endnote %}

To describe two past actions together: what was happening (past continuous) when something else happened (past simple).

{% note info %}
- The sun **was shining** and everyone **was enjoying** themselves when, all of sudden, we **heard** a bang.
- My sister’s husband **was working** in the garden when the neighbour **started** screaming.
- After all those weeks, the team **was** just **getting** ready to present when the fire alarm **went** off.
