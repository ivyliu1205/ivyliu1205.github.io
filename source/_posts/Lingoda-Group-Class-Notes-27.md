### Expressions

#### Different work schedule

- **4/10**: Employees work four 10-hour days, for a total of 40 hours each week.
- **9-9-6**: Employees work 9 AM to 9 PM six days, for a total of 72 hours each week.
- **9/80**: This work schedule gives employees an extra day off during each two-week cycle.

#### Talking about statistics

> Here are a few important grammatical rules to remember when you are dealing with statistics.

{% note info %}
Percentages are always **plural**. So whenever you say **`x%` of people…**, the verb never takes an *-s*.
{% endnote %}

- **25%** of British office workers **dislike** their colleagues.
- In a recent survey, it was revealed that **10%** of all employees regularly **steal** from their workplace.
- It is estimated that **1%** of all employees **earn** a seven-figure salary.

{% note info %}
We can use **per** to talk about frequency – or use the **indefinite article**.
{% endnote %}

- Around 30% of Americans work between 36 and 40 hours **per** week.
- Around 30% of Americans work between 36 and 40 hours **a** week.

{% note warn %}
We don’t, however, use the **definite article** in this way.  
  
[X] We have a team meeting three times the month.  
[V] **We have a team meeting three times per month.**  
[V] **We have a team meeting three times a month.**  
{% endnote %}

A common way of talking about statistics is to use ratios. Here, we say **x in y**:
- **One in three** working-age adults has a full-time job.
- Research suggests that **two in five employees** have suffered workplace discrimination.
 
We can also say **x out of every y**:
- **Three out of every four workers** gave their companies a positive rating.

#### Reading out percentages

The **%** is spoken as **per cent**: 
- **5%** reads as **five per cent**.
- **15%** is **fifteen per cent**.
 
In English, we read the decimal point as **point** and any zeros are pronounced either as **zero** or **oh**:
- **15.5%** is **fifteen point five per cent**.
- **15.05%** is either **fifteen point zero five per cent** or **fifteen point oh five per cent**.

Daniel is a very patient and friendly teacher. His teaching style is similar to that of most Lingoda teachers. He gives everyone a chance to speak and answer questions, and he is also good at controlling the pace of the class. This ensures that we can finish all the content on time and everyone gets plenty of practice. Additionally, he provides immediate feedback to help us improve.
