### Strategies to be able to talk to anyone

Here are some simple tips to make talking to people easier:

{% note light %}
- Get introduced to someone.
- Find common ground with the other person.
- Use ‘we’ or ‘us’ sentences.
- Ask the other person questions about themselves.
- Show a genuine interest in what the other person is saying.
- Listen carefully to the other person.
- Avoid overused questions, such as ‘What do you do?’
- Take care when offering compliments.
{% endnote %}
 
{% note info %}
A 'we' or 'us' sentence explicitly mentions 'we' or 'us' and creates a connection. 

Compare: 
- I'm looking forward to the talk this afternoon.
- I'm looking forward to the talk planned **for us** this afternoon.

Kevin was late to class by five minutes, and the session was interrupted by a call from his sister at the hospital. I understand that these were emergencies. However, because of these issues, he didn't cover all the material. He explained that he thought some of the content was unnecessary. From my perspective, one of the reasons for this could be that he spent too much time chatting with another classmate. I couldn't identify what I learned from this class because we only briefly covered the material. I believe today's class was an anomaly. Kevin is still a good person, and he always shares his own experiences, which is quite interesting.
