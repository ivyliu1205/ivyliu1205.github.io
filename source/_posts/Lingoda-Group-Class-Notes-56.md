### Expressions
> Contrasting and comparing

#### Comparing
To draw a comparison between two things we see as being alike, we use qualifiers like **both (and)**, particles like **also** and **too**, and the adjectival phrases **similar to** or **like**.

{% note info %}
**Both** Instagram and Twitter are picture-heavy.
Facebook has had a lot of bad press. Twitter is **also** coming under fire. TikTok, **too**, is facing criticism.
The way posts spread on social networks is **similar to/like** how rumours spread in the playground.
{% endnote %}

**Both** can be used as a qualifier (i.e. followed by nouns) or on its own as pronoun (i.e. replacing nouns).
{% note info %}
**Both** have their upsides and downsides.
{% endnote %}

As a qualfier, it can come before or after nouns.

{% note info %}
**Both** Instagram and Twitter are picture-heavy.
Instagram and Twitter are **both** picture-heavy.
{% endnote %}

**Too** can also change position, coming either straight after the subject or at the end of the sentence.

{% note info %}
TicToc, **too**, is facing criticism.
TicToc is facing criticism, **too**.
{% endnote %}

#### Contrasting
To highlight a contrast, we use **unlike** and conjunctions such as **while** or **whereas**.

{% note info %}
In the end, Twitter blocked Donald Trump - **unlike** many other networks.
**Whereas** adults have the emotional maturity to process social media, young children are not yet ready for it.
**While** many have turned away from Facebook in recent years, some users remain loyal.
{% endnote %}

When used for contrasting effect, **while** and **whereas** generally begin sentences.
