Describing a song often involves considering its different parts. We can talk about how it sounds, the feelings it brings out, what it's about, how it was made, and how it relates to our own experiences.

Alan is an engaging teacher with a lot of professional knowledge across various fields. His enthusiasm and expertise are evident in his classes. However, the transitions between topics can be too abrupt, and he sometimes moves on without addressing students’ feedback. Despite this, he remains a very interesting teacher.
