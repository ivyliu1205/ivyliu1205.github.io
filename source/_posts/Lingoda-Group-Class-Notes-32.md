This is the first time I've seen so many Chinese students. All three students today are Chinese. Maybe we were all attracted by the teacher's introduction, mentioning that he used to teach English in China. The teacher, John, is indeed a professional teacher. He's very skilled at managing the class, but he's not the kind of teacher who always gives detailed feedback immediately.
