**Using narrative tenses:**
- The narrative tenses are used together to talk about the past.

Salima was a very friendly and kind teacher. She always gave us positive feedback and equal opportunities to speak and read. However, her teaching approach was strictly following the lecture materials without incorporating external knowledge, and she didn't take too many notes during the class.
