**Exploring tone in emails**
   In business emails, it’s important to use a **professional** tone, meaning not rude or too friendly.

I struggled a little with today's judging point. Conrod was late to class and explained he felt unwell, so he didn't turn on his camera during today's class. He sounded quite unwell, as his voice was very low at times. However, his feedback to us was very detailed, including word and grammar usage and pronunciation. If someone made a mistake in pronunciation, he would stop and help them understand. I learned a lot from this class. If I get another chance, I will book another class with Conrod.
