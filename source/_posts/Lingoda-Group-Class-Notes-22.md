Today's class was my worst Lingoda class experience ever. The teacher, Jennifer, didn't finish all the content in the learning material. She didn't let us read the contents on the sides, and she didn't guided us through the example sentences. Despite this, she still didn't cover all the material. This was becasuse she spend around 10 minutes talking with another classmate about the war in Russia. Additionally, in a grammar class, she let us talk to each other without her for another 10 minutes, and this discussion was completely unrelated to the lesson content. Moreover, she couldn't answer a question asked by another classmate about the material. This class was a complete waste of time. Nonetheless, I still gave her one point for her engagement after I answered the questions.
