### Expressions
> Using the second conditional(第二条件句) for imaginary situations

Remember, we use the second conditional for **unreal situations in the present or future**.

We're **imagining the result** if the situation happened.

{% note info %}
- If she found out about it, she would be very upset.
- If I made a promise like that, I wouldn't break it.
- They would go to police if they heard anything.
{% endnote %}

We form the second conditional with **If + past simple** for the situation and **would + bare infinitive** for the result.

| Situation                              | Result                       |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **If** she **found out** about it,     | she **would be** very upset. |
| **If** I **made** a promise like that, | I** wouldn't break** it.     |
 

The **if** clause may come after the clause with the result.

In this case, there is no comma between the two clauses.

{% note info %}
- They would go to police if they heard anything.
- If they heard anything, they would go to the police.
{% endnote %}

#### Could instead of would for lower probability
We can also use **could + infinitive** in the result clause to state a possible, yet improbable result.

It is often combined with **ever** in the if clause.
{% note info %}
If you **ever** told your boss, she could lose her job.
They could find themselves in trouble if it **ever** came out.
{% endnote %}

Theresa is very good at explaining things, whether it's the definiations of words, the characteristics of characters in stories, or grammar. Her teaching style is very similar to that of my ESL in high school. I like her class. However, I prefer a teacher who can provide me with detailed feedback, which is slightly different from Theresa's teaching style.  That's why I gave her class a 4 out of 5.
