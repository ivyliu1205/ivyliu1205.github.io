## What I've learned

### Idioms
**to get away from it all**

- **Meaning**: to have a short holiday in a place where you can relax (informal)
- **Example**: *I can’t wait to **get away from it all** while I’m in Canada next week.*


### Expressions
> Giving reasons for why we travel

We can use the following phrases to give reasons for why we travel:

{% note info %}
- to escape from a stressful job
- to relax and rejuvenate
- to open our minds
- a different way of life
- to celebrate something
- to strengthen a relationship
- to have an adventure
{% endnote %}

{% note secondary %}
For me, travel is all about getting the chance to experience a completely different way of life!
{% endnote %}

When we **open our minds**, we accept **new ideas** or **different ways** of doing things.

Another common phrase is that travel **broadens** the mind, which carries a similar meaning.
