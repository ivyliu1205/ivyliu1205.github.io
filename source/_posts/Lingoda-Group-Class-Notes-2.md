Sprint START! My second group class with Lingoda.

Before class, I hadn't realized that the word "check" in the topic title refered to a summary of the previous full chapter. Even though I hadn't finished the entire chapter, I still completed the class successfully. Thanks to the teacher.

## What I've learned

### Idioms

**bang-up job**
- Meaning: very good or excellent work
- Example: *You've done a bang-up job giving your presentation!*

### Chapter Summary

#### Communicating your value

Describing your potential at work:
- Innovative
- Energetic
- Flexible
- Dependable
- Organised
- Communicative
- Creative
- Motivated
- Honest

Creating a personal pitch:
- A personal pitch is a way of giving someone a concise idea of your experience and skills
- Focus on what would make you a good fit for the job you're applying for.

#### More on relative clauses

Using defining relative clauses:
- A defining relative clause gives essential information about someone or something
- The most common relatve pronouns are **who**, **which**, **that** and **where**

Using non-defining relative clauses:
- Non-definiting relative clauses provide extra, non-essential information in a sentence.
- They can be removed from the sentence and the sentencs will still be complete.
- Commas are used before and after non-defining clauses.

More on non-defining rekative clauses:
- The relative pronouns in non-defining relative clauses are **who**, **which** and **whom**
- Prepositions(介词) can come at the end of the clause. In a more formal written style, they appear before the pronoun.

#### Landing your dream job

Describing responsibilities at work:
- Verbs: manage, coordinate, participate, delegate, oversee, optimise, seek out
- Noun: a must

Preparing for common interview questions:
- Why do you want to work for us?
- What are your strengths and weaknesses?
- Why are you interested in the job? What can you bring?

Preparing to get your dream job:
- Use a search engine and get some information about the company, industry and role.
- Choose two strengths that are related to your dream job.
- Think of the reasons you want your dream job. What can you bring to this job?

## Review

In today's class, I practiced both communication and writing. Since this is a "check" class, so I didn't learn something new, but that's ok. 

The teacher, Angela, is very friendly and always provides positive feedback to us. She teaches by focusing on the class material, and giving everyone equal opportunities to us to speak. That's great.
