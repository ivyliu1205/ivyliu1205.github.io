## What I've learned

### Idioms
**chin up!**
- Meaning: used to tell someone to stay cheerful in a difficult or unpleasant situation.
- Definition: ***Chin up!** Not everyone passes that exam first time.*

### Expressing encouragement

We can use the following phrases to encourage or motivate someone:
{% note info %}
- Hang in there!
- Stay at it!
- You can do it!
- Go for it!
- Give it your best!
- Stick at it!
- Give it a try!
- Just do it!
- It's worth a shot!
- You might as well!
- What are you waiting for?
- What have you got to lose?
{% endnote %}

{% note light %}
in this context, if someone says: *What have you got to lose?* their meaning is **not 100% literal**.

What they mean is: *Don't worry about it! I don't think you have anything to lose by trying.* 
{% endnote %}

### Leading support

Here are some typical phrases to show we support someone:
{% note info %}
- I've got your back!
- You can always count on me!
- You've got our support!
- We're with you all the way!
- We're all right behind you!
{% endnote %}

We can use **back** as a synonym for support, especially in **more informal** contexts.
- It can be used as a **noun**: e.g. *Don't worry! I've got your **back**.*
- Or as a **verb**: e.g. *Greg **backed** my decision to change jobs*.

## Review

Donna is a very talkative person. She always shares her own experiences with us. Her class is active, and no one will feel bored. She records all the mistakes we make in our speech in her notebooks and correct us after we finish talking. I learned a lot from her feedback. It would be even better if she simply recorded them in the slides.
