Francesca's introduction section was different from other classes. Instead of simply introducing ourselves, she had us introduce one of the most famous things from our hometown. I likeed this section. However, she didn't react much to our answers, which made me feel a little disappointed. Additionally, we had four students today, which was a large class. However, she was not very good at controlling the class. Whenever she asked a question, the class became a little chaotic. She also didn't give detailed and timely feedback, which was different from the teaching style I prefer. In another aspect, Francesca was a very friendly teacher.
