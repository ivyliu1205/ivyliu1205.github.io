## Review

3.5/5

{% endnote %}

Today's class is a one-on-one session. I thought it was supposed to be a two-student class, but another classmate canceled before it began. Today's class is at the B2.2 level, which is a bit higher than my level (B2.1). I know the level I was assigned is not accurate, and today's content was a little harder for me. There were many words I couldn't understand, but that's also why I chose this course. 

Sibo is a gentle and patient teacher. She lived in Hangzhou for four years, and she has a WeChat account, which is cool. She can point out the mistakes I make, but not all of them.
