### Expressions

There are several constructions and collocations which English speakers use when explaining the rules of a game to someone, or telling them how best to play it.

#### The ... is to + infinitive
This is how we phrase the aim of a game. Take a look at these examples:
- **The aim of the game is to score** as many points as possible.
- **The goal is** for you **to try** and **get** your pieces to the other side of the board.
- **The point of the game is** for the players **to get to know** each other.

{% note light %}
**Note**: the verb is always in the infinitive ((动词的)不定式) - even if persons are introduced (e.g. 'for you' or 'for the players').
{% endnote %}

#### Sequencers + present tense
When describing the steps players take in a game, sentences are often started with **sequencers** like *first, next, and finally*. **The verb is always in the simple present**.

- **First**, you have to roll the dice. Then you pass the dice to the next player.
- **Next**, you move your piece.
- **Finally**, you reach the end of the board.

#### Constructions with by + gerundive
To talk about how to score points, achieve your aims, or win a game, constructions with **by + gerundive (动名词) (-ing form)** are common.

- **By building** on your properties, you increase your income.
- You can get another turn by rolling two sixes.
- **By getting** all your pieces to the end of the board, you win the game.

{% note light %}
**Note**: when describing an option or a strategy, **by +ing** is often used with **can**.
*You **can** bluff **by pretending** to have better cards in your hand than your really do.*
{% endnote %}

#### Emphasising important points
Often, when explaining games - especially goals and rules - you need to place emphasis on important points. You do this by using the **...is to + infinitive** construction. Here are some examples.

- **The** most important thing **is to not forget** your turn!
- **What** you can never do **is to move** the pawn backwards.
- **A** key strategy **is to buy** early and cheap. 

As you can see, the first part of the sentence can start with **an article (冠词)** like **the** or **a** as well as **what** followed by a **verb**.

Another construction for emphasis is **...is that + present**. This is used to describe the facts of the game, not the goals you are pursuing.

- **What** you will notice **is that** other players often **miss** opportunities.
- **The** thing to remember **is that** resources on the board **are** limited.
- **A** really important point **is that** other players **can** see the card, too.

This is my second time with Angela. My second Lingoda class is also with Angela. However, that class was almost a month ago, so I've forgotten her teaching style. The timing of her class today is convenient for me, so I booked another session with her today.

Angela is a patient teacher. The biggest difference between her and my other teachers is that she always let us practice writing, even in a communication class. I like this aspect of her teaching. However, I prefer teachers who always give detailed feedback, which is slightly different from Angela's approach.
