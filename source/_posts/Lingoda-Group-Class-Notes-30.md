### Prouncation
Three Rules for the Pronunciation of **'ed'** when added to the end of present tense verbs to form past tense verbs: 

1. We ONLY pronounce BOTH letters of 'ed' as ED if the present tense verb ends in a 't' or a 'd', for example: *wanted* or *skidded*. In all other cases we do not pronounce the 'e' of 'ed', we only pronounce the 'd'. 
2. If a present tense verb ends in any **voiced consonant** (except d) such as (b, g, j, l, m, n, r, v, w, or z) or in a **vowel** (a, e, i, o, u, or y) which are also voiced, we pronounce the 'ed' as D. Examples with present tense verbs that end in voiced consonants: *rained*, *fibbed*, *killed*. Examples with present tense verbs that end in vowels: *lied*, *played*, or *skied*. 
3. If a present-tense verb ends in any **UNvoiced consonant (except t)**; sounds that are only made with air and are not voiced: such as (f, k, p, s, ch, sh, or x) we do not voice the 'd' either, so we pronounce the 'ed' as T, for example: *asked*, *shipped*, *kissed*, or *fixed*.

Wayne is a very professional teacher. He is excellent at controlling the pace of the class and can explain every definition in a simpler way. He is also an interesting teacher because he introduces himself with a model of the Earth and ends with a microphone. Additionally, he can point out and correct any mistakes we make in our pronunciation and explain the differences between British English and American English.
