Claire is a truly professional teacher. She has a great sense of humor and always gives us confidence. Although the topic I chose was a reading class, I learned both of reading and speaking in Claire's class. Instead of strictly following the structure of learning materials completely, Claire uses the storis from the materials and encourages us to express our own opinions about the stories to help us practice speaking. I really like Clarie's teaching style. I will book another class with her in the future.
