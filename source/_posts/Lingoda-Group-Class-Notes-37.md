### Expressions

#### Adjective Order
As you know, adjectives describe nouns. 

{% note info %}
- Is the **red** bag yours?
- That luggage trolley is **broken**.
- What type of suitcase is it? It’s a **metallic** one.
{% endnote %}

When **several adjectives** are used **before a noun**, they are ordered by category. For example: 
{% note info %}
- If an adjective describing **size** is used, it is always first.
- If the **colour** is mentioned, it comes second.
- The **material** or other details come next.
{% endnote %}

- I prefer the **small**, **black** shoulder bag.
- He’s looking for a **big**, **red**, **metallic** suitcase.
- It’s a **medium-sized**, **hard-shelled** Samsonite case
- They've lost a **beige**, **cloth** tote-bag.
 

Let's break this down as a table:

|                    | size          | colour | material     |               |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------ | ------------ | ------------- |
| I prefer the       | small,        | black  | -            | shoulder bag. |
| He's looking for a | big,          | red,   | metallic     | suitcase.     |
| It's a             | medium-sized, | -      | hard-shelled | Samsonite.    |
| They've lost a     | -             | beige, | cloth        | tote-bag.     |
 

If this order is changed, the sentence can sound strange, and some people may not understand.

{% note warn %}
Mistakes to avoid:
✘ Hers is the cotton, blue, little bag.
✓ Hers is the **little**, **blue**, **cotton** bag.
{% endnote %}

#### Reviewing question forms

Questions change the way sentences are structured. Importantly, they change the way **verbs** work. See if you can spot what happens when we take these sentences and turn them into questions:

{% note info %}
**Statement**: You understand the problem.
**Question**: Do you understand the problem?

**Statement**: You are staying at Hotel Sombrero.
**Question**: Which hotel are you staying at?/Where are you staying?

**Statement**: I can help you.
**Question**: How can I help you?

**Statement**: That option isn’t available.
**Question**: Isn’t that option available?

**Statement**: You could give me a refund.
**Question**: Could you give me a refund?
{% endnote %}
 
Here are some important things to note about using question forms in English: 

{% note info %}
- The subject and the verb are **inverted**
- **Regular verbs** need the auxiliary verb *to do* in the present simple tense
  - Other key verbs - *to be* and the modals (e.g. *can*, *would*, *should*) - don't need this auxiliary verb
- We use **question words** (e.g. *How...? When...? Where...?*) to ask for information
