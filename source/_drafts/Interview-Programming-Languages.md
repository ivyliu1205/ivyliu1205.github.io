## Common Questions

### Interpreted Language vs. Compiled Lauguage

{% note info %}
- Interpreted Language: Python, JavaScript
- Compiled Lauguage: C, C++
{% endnote %}

| No.  | Compiled Language                                                                        | Interpreted Language                                                                                                                                        |

| 1    | A compiled language is converted into machine code so that the processor can execute it. | An interpreted language is a language in which the implementations execute instructions directly without earlier compiling a program into machine language. |
| 2    | The compiled programs run faster than interpreted programs.                              | The interpreted programs run slower than the compiled program.                                                                                              |
| 3    | In a compiled language, the code can be executed by the CPU.                             | In Interpreted languages, the program cannot be compiled, it is interpreted.                                                                                |
